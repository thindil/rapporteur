## Provides API to send reports from an application to the project's server.
## Usually, before sending a report, the library requires initialization with
## procedure `initRapport`:
##
##     initRapport(httpAddress = 'https://mysite.com', key = "myAppKey")
##
## Setting key to **DEADBEEF** value will disable sending reports.
##
## To send a report to a server, use procedure `sendRapport`:
##
##     sendRapport(content = "My message here")

import std/[hashes, httpclient, uri]
import contracts

type
  RapportError* = object of CatchableError
    ## Raised when there is a problem with the project, like not initialized,
    ## etc.
  RapportKey* = string
    ## Used to store the application key
  RapportContent* = string
    ## Used to store a report's content

var
  serverAddress: Uri = parseUri(uri = "")
  appKey: RapportKey = ""

  ##                 be send. Must be a valid address.
  ## * key         - the application key used in the server authentication. Must
  ##                 be the same as on the server. Setting it to `DEADBEEF` will
  ##                 disable sending reports.
